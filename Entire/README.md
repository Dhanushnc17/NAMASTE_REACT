  - React.createElement() => creates React Element(JS Object) => root.render => converts it to HTML(Browser Understands)
  - JSX => Babel Transpiles it to React.createElement() => creates React Element(JS Object) => root.render => converts it to HTML(Browser Understands)
  - JSX -> It is a HTML or XML like syntax -> But not HTML or XML inside JS
  - Babel is Converting JSX to React.createElement() (It is a JS Compiler)
  - JSX -> jsx code is TRANSPILED before it goes to the JS Engine => Done by parcel using BABEL PACKAGE
  - Transpiled -> initial code is converted to the code that js engine and browser understands

# React Components

- Class Based Components(older way)
- Functional Components(New way)

# Component :

- A component is a normal javascript function that returns some piece of jsx or react element

# Component Composition :

- Composing components into one another or simply Putting components inside other components
  <br>
- JSX sanitizes the data that we pass in that prevents cross site scripting
